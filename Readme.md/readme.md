# Purpose
The purpose of my website was to create a portfolio to track my projects and personal growth during this course for possible employers. It will show the projects I create and the skills I'll acquire throughout this course.

# Functionality / features
This website was created purely with HTML and CSS, it was all linked to one CSS stylesheet named "portfolio.css" It consists of 5 main links, Home, About, Contact, Blog and Projects. Each page has a navigation bar at the top, the home, blog and about page all have social media links to my twitter, linkedin and github profile. The homepage had a link to my resume which opened another tab in the browser to a downloadable PDF. The code was well organised and easy to read for personal navigation and educators when marking.
